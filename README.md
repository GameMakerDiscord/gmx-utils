# gmx-utils

This repository contains the source code for a Command-Line Interface (CLI) that can be used along side Gamemaker Studio 2 to automatically truncate project scripts, manage, and manipulate extension data. This is useful for large packages where it would be a waste of time to manually update extension information for every script after every unique build.

## Building
Required Visual Studio with Visual Basic to compile. Simply [download the zip](https://github.com/GameMakerDiscord/GMExtensionUtilities/archive/master.zip), or clone the repository with 
```
git clone git@github.com:GameMakerDiscord/GMExtensionUtilities.git
```

## Release
Download the pre-built executables from https://github.com/GameMakerDiscord/GMExtensionUtilities/releases (`gmx-utils.zip`)

## Installation
Once you have the executable, there is no more required installation. Run the executable from your favourite command line tool.

If you want to go to extra mile, add the executable path to your `PATH` environment variable for easy access.

## Dependencies
Newtonsoft JSON v12.0.2
